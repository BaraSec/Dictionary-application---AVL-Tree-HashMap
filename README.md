# Dictionary application - AVL Tree & HashMap DSs

This was my solution to a Data Structures course's thirf project in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing. It's an application based on the AVL Tree & HashMap Data Structures.

The project's description that was sent to the course's students is available at `Description/COMP242 Project3.pdf`.
